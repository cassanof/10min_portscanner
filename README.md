# Challenged myself into making a python scanner in 10 minutes. This is the monster that got created.
### What could I have made better?
 - Used `threading` instead of `_thread` so I could actually make a waitgroup instead of using `input()`
 - Defined the timeout for the connect.
 - Made the thing in **Go** because python is bloated.
 - Nothing else, its perfect. Better than nmap for sure.
